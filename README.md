## about:

This is a web app designed to store and present notes, links, images, etc while allowing me to practice designing a functional web page.

## (desired) functionality:

on each language page, there will be cards that are loaded from a database. These cards will appear in a grid with only the header visible. When clicked, it will expand to take up the entire row, displacing other items, and show the content of the notes, links, images, etc.

in the create page, there will be forms/widgets that will allow users to create new entries into the database, which will then appear on their respective page.

it should also have validations for security, as well as a search bar.
